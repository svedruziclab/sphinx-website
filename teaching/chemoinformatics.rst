Course description
------------------

The aim of the course is to enable students to acquire knowledge and skills with which they can independently do basic computer analyzes of the structure and function of biomolecules. Theoretical settings for studying the structure and function of molecules in parallel with the computational approaches will be presented. The aim of the course is to enable students to visually imagine the material they have learned in previous courses.


Learning outcomes
-----------------

Upon completion of the course the students will be able to:

#. Independently search databases containing molecular structures, and identify different types of computational records of molecular structures
#. Self-assess the physical properties of small molecules and large biomolecules
#. Calculate molecular orbitals and electron densities on small molecules independently using quantum chemistry programs
#. Identify functional groups and flexible parts in small molecule structures, and identify functional parts in large biomolecules (proteins, DNA and RNA molecules, biological membranes, complex carbohydrates)
#. Numerically simulate and optimize measurements of enzyme activity and dose curve measurements

Lectures
^^^^^^^^

#. Summary of the material, through examples we will show why computational approaches are important for biochemistry and design of new drugs. Most of the examples will be from our research
#. Calculation and presentation of different physical properties of small molecules. Names, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics and molecular conformations, 3D overlapping of molecules, LogP and LogD values, pKa values, titration curves, tautomeric and enantiomers. NMR spectra. Presentation of databases containing small molecule structures. Software used: :ref:`ChemAxon Marvin <software-marvin>`, :ref:`Avogadro <software-avogadro>`, and :ref:`VMD <software-vmd>`
#. QM/MM analyzes of atomic orbitals, molecular orbitals, and HOMO-LUMO orbitals. Software used: :ref:`Avogadro <software-avogadro>`, :ref:`GAMESS (US) <software-gamess-us>`, :ref:`wxMacMolPlt <software-wxmacmolplt>`, and Wavefunction Spartan
#. Basics of crystallographic and NMR methods for macromolecule structure analysis. Presentation of databases containing structures of large biomolecules. Organization of PDB documents and algorithms for displaying molecules on computers
#. Analyzes of structural domains, active sites, b-factors, and surface shapes, electrostatic potentials, and hydrophobicity. Basics of comparison of structures by overlaying structures based on amino acid sequence and calculating RMSD and RMSF values. Viewing and analysis of the structure of biological macromolecules. Software used: :ref:`PyMOL <software-pymol>`, :ref:`UCSF Chimera <software-chimera>`, and :ref:`VMD <software-vmd>`
#. Protein structures. Analyzes of the structures of different proteins and associated structural elements
#. DNA and RNA molecules, and proteins that bind to DNA and RNA molecules
#. DNA damage and repair, DNA methylation, and epigenetic mechanisms will be presented as an illustrative example of recent research
#. Biological membranes and membrane proteins. Membrane receptors and ion channels, molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease, neurochemistry and psychopharmacology
#. Basic analyzes of enzyme activity using numerical simulations with :ref:`KinTek <software-kintek>` and Microsoft Excel (or :ref:`LibreOffice Calc <software-libreoffice-calc>`). Students will learn what the catalytic cycle is and how enzyme and substrate concentrations affect the measurement of enzyme activity. Students will learn how to determine the concentration of an active enzyme in a reaction
