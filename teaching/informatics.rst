Course description
------------------

The course is designed to prepare biotechnology students for processing of the scientific data. As such, the course content is focused on:

#. Identifying and upgrading basic IT knowledge acquired by students during secondary education regardless of the type of educational profile with the aim of equalizing IT knowledge
#. Acquiring knowledge about the basic concepts of modern information technology: principles of computer system operation (hardware and software), computer networks and databases, supercomputers and parallel data processing, and licensing
#. Introduction to advanced computer systems for computer chemistry, molecular modeling and bioinformatics that are used in biotechnology


Learning outcomes
-----------------

Upon the completion of the course the students will be able to:

#. Distinguish and explain the basic concepts of information and computer technology
#. Define and distinguish between elements of a networked computer system (computer hardware and software)
#. Explain how parallel data processing works on a supercomputer
#. Categorize commonly used software and dataset licenses
#. Search the databases used in computational chemistry, molecular modeling and bioinformatics
#. Use basic operating system functions
#. Distinguish between numerical and symbolic computation and choose the appropriate one for a given problem
