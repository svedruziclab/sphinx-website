Biomolecular Structure and Function Group | BioSFGroup
======================================================

    My own prejudices are exactly the opposite of the functionalists': *"If you want to understand function, study structure,"* [emphasis added] I was supposed to have said in my molecular biology days. (I believe I was sailing at the time.) I think that one should approach these problems at all levels, as was done in molecular biology. Classical genetics is, after all, a black-box subject. The important thing was to combine it with biochemistry. *In nature hybrid species are usually sterile, but in science the reverse is often true. Hybrid subjects are often astonishingly fertile, whereas if a scientific discipline remains too pure it usually wilts.* [emphasis added]
