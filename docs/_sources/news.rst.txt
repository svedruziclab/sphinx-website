Structural Analysis of Simultaneous Activation and Inhibition of Gamma-Secretase Activity in Development of Drugs for Alzheimers Disease (22nd September 2020)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our research preprint titled `Structural Analysis of Simultaneous Activation and Inhibition of Gamma-Secretase Activity in Development of Drugs for Alzheimers Disease <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.307959v1>`__ has been uploaded to `BioRxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/>`__.

Abstract
^^^^^^^^

Significance: The majority of drugs that target membrane-embedded protease gamma-secretase show unusual biphasic activation-inhibition dose-response in cells, model animals, and humans. Semagacestat and avagacestat are two biphasic-drugs that can facilitate cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimers disease. Initial mechanistic studies showed that the biphasic-drugs, and pathogenic mutations, can produce the same type of changes in γ-secretase activity.

Results: DAPT, semagacestat LY-411,575, and avagacestat are four drugs that show different binding constants, and biphasic activation-inhibition dose-response curves, for amyloid-beta-40 products in SHSY-5 cells. Multiscale molecular dynamics studies showed that all four drugs bind to the most mobile parts in presenilin structure, at different ends of the 29 A long active site tunnel. Combined results from structure-activity studies, showed that the biphasic dose-response curves are a result of modulation of gamma-secretase activity by concurrent binding of multiple drug molecules at each end of the active site tunnel. The drugs activate gamma-secretase by forcing the active site tunnel to open, when the rate-limiting step is the tunnel opening, and formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The drugs inhibit gamma-secretase as uncompetitive inhibitors, by binding next to the substrate to dynamic enzyme structures that regulate processive catalysis. The drugs can modulate the production of different amyloid-beta catalytic intermediates, by penetrating into the active site tunnel to different depth with different binding affinity. The drugs and pathogenic mutations affect the same dynamic processes in gamma-secretase structure.

Conclusions: Biphasic-drugs like disease-causing mutations can reduce the catalytic capacity of gamma-secretase and facilitate pathogenic changes in amyloid metabolism.

Substrate Channeling via a Transient Protein-Protein Complex: The case of D-Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase and L-Lactate Dehydrogenase published in Nature Scientific Reports (26th June 2020)

Abstract
^^^^^^^^

Substrate channeling studies have frequently failed to provide conclusive results due to poor understanding of this subtle phenomenon. We analyzed the mechanism of NADH-channeling from D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to L-lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) using enzymes from different cells. Enzyme kinetics studies showed that LDH activity with free NADH and GAPDH-NADH complex always take place in parallel. The channeling is observed only in assays that mimic cytosolic conditions where free NADH concentration is negligible and the GAPDH-NADH complex is dominant. Molecular dynamics and protein-protein interaction studies showed that LDH and GAPDH can form a leaky channeling complex only at the limiting NADH concentrations. Surface calculations showed that positive electric field between the NAD(H) binding sites on LDH and GAPDH tetramers can merge in the LDH-GAPDH complex. NAD(H)-channeling within the LDH-GAPDH complex can be an extension of NAD(H)-channeling within each tetramer. In the case of a transient LDH-(GAPDH-NADH) complex, the relative contribution from the channeled and the diffusive paths depends on the overlap between the off-rates for the LDH-(GAPDH-NADH) complex and the GAPDH-NADH complex. Molecular evolution or metabolic engineering protocols can exploit substrate channeling for metabolic flux control by fine-tuning substrate-binding affinity for the key enzymes in the competing reaction paths.

Substrate Channeling via a Transient Protein-Protein Complex: The case of D-Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase and L-Lactate Dehydrogenase published on bioRxiv (23rd January 2020)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background: D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can form a complex that can regulate the major metabolic pathways, however, the exact mechanism remains unknown. We analyzed a possibility of NADH-channeling from GAPDH-NADH complex to LDH isozymes using enzymes from different cells.

Results: Enzyme-kinetics and NADH-binding studies showed that LDH can use GAPDH-NADH complex as a substrate. LDH activity with GAPDH-NADH complex was challenged with anti-LDH antibodies to show that the channeled and the diffusive reactions always take place in parallel. The channeling path is dominant only in assays with limiting free-NADH concertation that mimic cytosolic conditions. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the channeling does not require a high affinity complex. Molecular dynamics calculations and protein-protein interaction studies showed that LDH and GAPDH can form a leaky channeling complex only at subsaturating NADH concentrations. The interaction sites are conserved between LDH isozymes from heart and muscle, and between GAPDH molecules from rabbit and yeast cells. Positive electric fields between the NAD(H) binding sites on LDH and GAPDH tetramers, showed that NAD(H)-channeling within the LDH-GAPDH complex, can be an extension of NAD(H)-channeling between the adjacent subunits in each tetramer.

Conclusions: In the case of a transient (GAPDH-NADH)-LDH complex, the relative contribution from the channeled and the diffusive paths depends on the overlap between off-rates for the transient (GAPDH-NADH)-LDH complex and off-rates for the GAPDH-NADH complex. Molecular evolution or metabolic engineering protocols can exploit substrate channeling for metabolic flux control by fine-tuning substrate-binding affinity for the key enzymes in the competing reaction paths.

Pro-Inflammatory S100A9 Protein Aggregation Promoted by NCAM1 Peptide Constructs published in ACS Chemical Biology (5th June 2019)

Abstract
^^^^^^^^

Amyloid cascade and neuroinflammation are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, and pro-inflammatory S100A9 protein is central to both of them. Here, we have shown that NCAM1 peptide constructs carrying polycationic sequences derived from Aβ peptide (KKLVFF) and PrP protein (KKRPKP) significantly promote the S100A9 amyloid self-assembly in a concentration-dependent manner by making transient interactions with individual S100A9 molecules, perturbing its native structure and acting as catalysts. Since the individual molecule misfolding is a rate-limiting step in S100A9 amyloid aggregation, the effects of the NCAM1 construct on the native S100A9 are so critical for its amyloid self-assembly. S100A9 rapid self-assembly into large aggregated clumps may prevent its amyloid tissue propagation, and by modulating S100A9 aggregation as a part of the amyloid cascade, the whole process may be effectively tuned.

In silico design of the first DNA-independent mechanism-based inhibitor of mammalian DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 published in PLOS ONE (11th April 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our research paper titled `In silico design of the first DNA-independent mechanism-based inhibitor of mammalian DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0174410>`__ authored by :ref:`Vedran Miletić <lab-people>`, :ref:`Ivica Odorčić <lab-people>`, :ref:`Patrik Nikolić <lab-people>`, and :ref:`Željko Svedružić <zms>` has been published today in `PLOS ONE <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/>`__, the flagship Open Access journal.

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

We use our earlier experimental studies of the catalytic mechanism of DNA methyltransferases to prepare in silico a family of novel mechanism-based inhibitors of human Dnmt1. Highly specific inhibitors of DNA methylation can be used for analysis of human epigenome and for the creation of iPS cells.

Results
^^^^^^^

We describe a set of adenosyl-1-methyl-pyrimidin-2-one derivatives as novel mechanism-based inhibitors of mammalian DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. The inhibitors have been designed to bind simultaneously in the active site and the cofactor site and thus act as transition-state analogues. Molecular dynamics studies showed that the lead compound can form between 6 to 9 binding interactions with Dnmt1. QM/MM analysis showed that the upon binding to Dnmt1 the inhibitor can form a covalent adduct with active site Cys1226 and thus act as a mechanism-based suicide-inhibitor. The inhibitor can target DNA-bond and DNA-free form of Dnmt1, however the suicide-inhibition step is more likely to happen when DNA is bound to Dnmt1. The validity of presented analysis is described in detail using 69 modifications in the lead compound structure. In total 18 of the presented 69 modifications can be used to prepare a family of highly specific inhibitors that can differentiate even between closely related enzymes such as Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a DNA methyltransferases.

Conclusions
^^^^^^^^^^^

Presented results can be used for preparation of some highly specific and potent inhibitors of mammalian DNA methylation with specific pharmacological properties.

Discussing `the study programmes at the Department of Biotechnology <https://www.biotech.uniri.hr/en/study-programmes.html>`__, Dr. Svedružić was optimistic about their future in spite of the present challenges:

    *Two years ago, economic experts in the German government pointed out that the development of biotechnology was the future of German industry. Finally, the pharmaceutical and related biochemical industries are today among the few industries in Croatia that are positively operating and competitive in the international market, despite a lagging administrative and political environment. Therefore, the facts show that studying biotechnology has a future, if the opportunities are exploited.*
