Former wiki
===========

    The Wiki is no more! Whatever semblance of reference material and content organization it once provided is a phantom, a memory. With our :ref:`GROMACS <software-gromacs>` simulations left unchecked, who will you turn to for trajectories? The devastation wrought by the corrupted checkpoints is self-evident. We have seen our proteins and ligands destroyed by the calculation bugs of :ref:`AmberTools <software-ambertools-acpype>`. We have seen first hand our colleagues and collaborators consumed by the publication process. Unprecedented and unimaginable though they may be, these are the signs of our time.

During June 2018 the main website has been migrated from `Baseline <https://github.com/ajlkn/baseline>`__ to :ref:`Sphinx <software-docutils-sphinx>` and `Boostrap <https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme>`__. The contents of the former wiki are now :ref:`an integral part of the website <group-software>`.
